// Messi goals function

// Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:

// LaLiga
// Copa del Rey
// Champions
// Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.

// Note: the input will always be valid.

// For example:

// 5, 10, 2  -->  17



//my solution strategy takes in variables that each contain an integer value and then adds them together to return the total amount of goals.
function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
    // code goes here
    return laLigaGoals + copaDelReyGoals + championsLeagueGoals;
  }
